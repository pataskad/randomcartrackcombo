# Random Track and Car generator using Javascript #

    This project is simple in nature and provides a quick, randomized function to select a car and track combination for a weekly league on the game iRacing.

# Development plan and scope #
    Over time this project will evolve as my knowledge and skills using Javascript increase.  To start, this project will be crude in nature but will become more complex over time. This project starts with pre-set track and car lists with one function to select a car/track combo on a random roll basis.  Additionally,this project allows a user to both add and remove their own selection of tracks and cars to randomly select from upon the click of a button(function).

    Currently any modifications are made in session and not saved upon a site refresh/reload.  This is a future addition that may be added as development gets further down the road.

# Technologies utilized #
    Javascript with some JQuery, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap v4.1.3, CSS cdn only as of v1.0.0, Django/Python
